## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a vibrant, modern UI with a multi-color palette (Blue, Purple, Green) and a contemporary glassmorphic design. It incorporates a gradient header, a dark blue-gray sidebar, and subtle gradient backgrounds. Typography uses Inter for UI text and Roboto Mono for numerical displays. Shadcn UI components, styled with an orange accent, are utilized for a responsive design optimized for tablet and desktop use. The Login page features a professional blue split-screen design with a sign-in form and feature icons grid.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Built with React, TypeScript, React hooks, and TanStack Query for state management. Styling uses Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
- **Backend**: Developed with Express and TypeScript.
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication using `express-session` with PostgreSQL session store (`connect-pg-simple`) and `bcrypt` for password hashing. Sessions persist across restarts and republishing. All API routes are secured.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM for persistent storage. All data persists across application restarts and republishing.
- **Order Counter**: Race-condition-free implementation using dedicated `orderCounters` table with row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`), well-known singleton ID ('order-counter'), and atomic `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` upsert to guarantee unique, monotonically increasing order numbers even under concurrent load.
- **API**: Provides RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, orders, tables, items, purchases, employees, and authentication. Backend returns JSON error responses with `{error: "message"}` format for consistent frontend error handling.
- **Core Workflows**: Includes a complete POS order workflow with draft management, receipt printing, and multiple payment methods. Comprehensive CRUD operations are supported across all management modules.
- **Permissions**: Role-based permissions system with granular controls.
- **Cache Invalidation**: React Query cache invalidation ensures real-time UI updates across POS, Purchase, Inventory, Dashboard, and Reporting modules upon relevant data changes.
- **Error Handling**: Frontend `apiRequest` function parses backend JSON error responses and extracts user-friendly messages for toast notifications. Toast system uses Shadcn UI with fixed React hook implementation for proper state management.

### Feature Specifications
- **Authentication**: Secure login, session management, and protected API routes.
- **POS Order Workflow**: Supports draft saving, editing, diverse payment methods (Cash, Card, ABA, Acleda, Due, Cash And ABA, Cash And Acleda), split payments, and receipt generation. When "Cash And ABA" or "Cash And Acleda" is selected, the payment modal automatically triggers split payment mode, allowing users to specify the exact amounts for each payment method. Both payment methods are then displayed separately in the Sales List.
- **Sales Management**: Displays complete order history with detailed item breakdowns, comprehensive reports (Detailed Sales Report, Sales Summary Report) with filtering, editing, printing, and export capabilities (Excel, PDF).
- **Item Management**: CRUD for items and categories, image management, search, filtering, and bulk import/export (Excel/CSV). Comprehensive duplicate name validation with specific error messages ("Already uploaded" for creating duplicates, "Duplicate name" for updating to an existing name, "Already updated" for no-change updates). Bulk import includes per-row duplicate detection and error reporting.
- **Expense Management**: Full CRUD for expenses and categories, optional slip/invoice image uploads, summary statistics, and a colorful, enhanced UI.
- **Purchase Management**: CRUD for purchases and categories, search, filtering, and bulk import/export. Integrates with inventory to automatically update stock levels and create adjustment records upon purchase creation.
- **Table Management**: CRUD for tables, capacity tracking, status management, direct printing, and options to edit/add items or complete orders for occupied tables.
- **HRM**: Full employee management (CRUD, import/export, schedule upload) with schemas for Attendance, Leave, and Payroll.
- **Inventory Management**: Comprehensive control with tabs for All Products (CRUD, bulk actions), Stock Overview, Low Stock Alerts (with one-click restock), and Adjustment History. Features automatic stock deduction on sales, manual adjustments, and import/export capabilities.
- **Reporting System**: Comprehensive reports for Sales, Inventory, Discounts, Refunds, and Staff Performance with flexible filtering (date range, payment status, payment gateway) and export options (CSV, PDF). Includes an Account History breakdown by payment method.
- **Bank Statement**: Dedicated payment dashboard displaying sales breakdown by payment method, summary statistics, date filtering, and export capability. Payment method cards are clickable to show detailed transaction history for each method, including proper handling of split payments where only the amount paid with the selected method is displayed.
- **Branch Management**: Multi-location system with CRUD for branches, secure branch-level authentication with login capability, data isolation, and API endpoints for management. Branch users can log in using their branch username and password through the main login page. The system validates credentials against both users and branches tables, creating appropriate session data (branchId, username, role="branch", userType="branch" for branch logins). Passwords are hashed with bcrypt (10 salt rounds) and never exposed in API responses.
- **System Settings**: Extensive configuration options including General, Payment Methods, Tax & Discount, Receipt & Invoice, User & Access, Printer & Hardware, Currency & Localization, Backup & Data, Notifications, and Customization. Includes configurable stock thresholds and secondary currency options with custom exchange rates for dual-currency printing.

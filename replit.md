## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a vibrant, modern UI with a multi-color palette (Blue, Purple, Green) and a contemporary design aesthetic. It includes a gradient header, a dark blue-gray sidebar, and subtle gradient backgrounds throughout. Typography uses Inter for UI text and Roboto Mono for numerical displays. Shadcn UI components are heavily utilized, styled with an orange accent color to align with BondPos branding. The design is responsive, optimized for tablet and desktop use.

**Login Page**: Professional blue split-screen design. Left panel (40%) features dark blue gradient background with BondPos logo, sign-in form with white input fields (User/Lock icons), password visibility toggle, blue button, OR divider, and social login buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Google). Right panel (60%) displays feature icons grid (Analytics, Orders, Sales, POS) with title "Point of Sale Management System" and pagination dots. Responsive with slide-in animations.

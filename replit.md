## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The system features a vibrant, modern UI with a multi-color palette (Blue, Purple, Green) and a contemporary design aesthetic. It includes a gradient header, a dark blue-gray sidebar, and subtle gradient backgrounds throughout. Typography uses Inter for UI text and Roboto Mono for numerical displays. Shadcn UI components are heavily utilized, styled with an orange accent color to align with BondPos branding. The design is responsive, optimized for tablet and desktop use.

**Login Page**: Professional blue split-screen design. Left panel (40%) features dark blue gradient background with BondPos logo, sign-in form with white input fields (User/Lock icons), password visibility toggle, blue button, OR divider, and social login buttons (Facebook, Twitter, Google). Right panel (60%) displays feature icons grid (Analytics, Orders, Sales, POS) with title "Point of Sale Management System" and pagination dots. Responsive with slide-in animations.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Built with React and TypeScript, leveraging React hooks and TanStack Query for state management. Styling is handled with Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI.
- **Backend**: Developed using Express and TypeScript.
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication is implemented using `express-session` and `bcrypt` for password hashing, securing all API routes with middleware.
- **Storage**: Currently uses an in-memory `MemStorage` implementation for all data.
- **API**: Provides RESTful APIs for managing products, categories, orders, tables, items, purchases, employees, and authentication.
- **Core Workflows**: Includes a complete POS order workflow with draft management, receipt printing, and multiple payment methods. Comprehensive CRUD operations are supported across all management modules (Items, Purchases, Tables, Employees).
- **Permissions**: Role-based permissions system with granular controls for reports, settings, refunds, and inventory.
- **Cache Invalidation Pattern**: React Query cache invalidation ensures real-time UI updates without manual refresh. All inventory-affecting mutations (order completion, product CRUD, stock adjustments) invalidate: `/api/products`, `/api/inventory/adjustments`, and low-stock queries (via predicate matching on key prefix `/api/inventory/low-stock`). This pattern guarantees synchronized data across POS, Inventory, and reporting modules.

### Feature Specifications
